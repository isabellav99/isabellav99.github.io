          <h2 id="about">I'm Isabella.</h2>
          <p>And storytelling, for me, is as primal a need as eating. I began telling stories in the second grade when I wrote my first "novel" in a fuzzy blue notebook. As a teenage I took up theater, portraying life through song and
            dance. Today, I study journalism at the University of Miami, and I've written about dozens of personalitiesâ€”Billy Corben, the unofficial "Miami Man" and director of the Cocaine Cowboys documentaries, Chris Korge, the finance chair for the
            Democratic National Committee, Ella Titus, one of Miami City Ballet's youngest corp members, etc. As editor-in-chief of our lifestyle publication, Distraction, I've been fortunate to report, write, design and sometimes even photograph my
            little heart out. But these are not the only stories I tell on UM's campus. As an honors communication student, I am also a serious student of episodic and feature-length content and have written original and spec scripts for my film
            classes. As a theatre arts minor, I've studied acting and directing and performed in two MainStage productions at the U. I have learned the ins and outs of Premiere video editing and how to capture striking video content using nothing but
            my iPhone and a stabilizer. I want to be a storyteller 'when I grow up,' and I'm eager to discover exactly how my passion will turn into a career. </p>
